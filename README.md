# The Journey #
1. I am beginning to learn Python and will be adding my projects here.
2. I will be adding some very beginning level stuff and getting more complex as I learn. 
3. I'm hoping to get more complex and figure these things out this is just a start but this will get better.

### Modulo ###
The Modulo program tests a number if it is divisble by 10. Need to get into the habbit of adding more comments. But its a start. 

### Travel Log ###
I am more excited about this one. Theres a little more complexity here. Theres actually user input and a list. Basically, it creates a list for cities traveled to.
